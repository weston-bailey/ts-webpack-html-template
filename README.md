# ðŸ“¦ TypeScript Webpack Vanilla Html Boilerplate

This is template code to serve up a vanilla html website using node.js, webpack, and typeScript.  The advantage being modules, typeScript, and all nodejs features are easily supported and are transpiled to vanilla js. 

## Getting started

* fork and clone this repo
* cd into the directory and run `npm i` to download the required packages
* use `npm run start` to build and serve the application 
* Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the site
* use `npm run test-all` to run all tests in the `./tests` folder
  
> `./src` contains dev code and the output of webpack can be found in `./dist`

---

#### The following scripts can be run from the `package.json`

`npm run start`

> builds the `src` directory to the `dist` directory and serves on `port 3000`

`npm run build` 

>  runs a production build of the `./src` directory to the `./dist` directory.

`npm run test < file name >` 

> runs any tests found in the file

`npm run test-all` 

> runs all tests found with the filenameing convention `fileName.test.extension`

## Dependencies 

* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) -- used to bundle the website together
* [webpack-cli](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/) -- used to build the website
* [webpack-html-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/) -- webpack plugin for building vanilla html sites
* [css-loader (webpack)](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/) -- webpack plugin for loading vanilla css
* [style-loader (webpack)](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/style-loader/) -- webpack plugin for loading vanilla css
* [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) -- file watch utility that re-runs scripts when files change
* [express](https://expressjs.com/) -- to serve the bundled static files from the `./dist` directory
* [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) -- for running unit tests
* [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) -- assertion library for testing
* [typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)

## Notes


* the port that the dev server runs on can be changed in the `package.json` start script
* `index.html` is the only html page the wabpack builds, so it is assumed that this will the be boilerplate for a SPA 
  
## Todos

* automate adding addition html files
